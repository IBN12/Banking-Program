<h3>Synopsis</h3>
Banks offer various types of accounts, such as savings, checking, certificate of deposit, and money market,
to attract customers as well as meet their specific needs. Two of the most commonly used accounts are savings
and checking. Each of these accounts has various options. For example, you may have a savings account that requires 
no minimum balance but has a lower interest rate. Similarly, you may have a checking account that limits the number
of checks you may write. Another type of account that is used to save money for the long term is certificate of deposit (CD).

Savings accounts: Suppose that the bank offers two types of savings accounts: one that has no minimum balance and a lower 
interest rate and another that requires a minimum balance and has a higher interst rate.

Checking accounts: Suppose that the bank offers three types of checking accounts: one with a monthly service charge, limited check
writing, no minimum balance, and no interest; another with no monthly service charge, a minimum balance requirement, unlimited check
writing, and lower interest; and a third with no monthly service charge, a higher minimum requirement, a higher interest rate, and 
unlimited check writing.

Certificate of deposit (CD): In an account of this type, money is left for some time, and these accounts draw higher interest rates
than savings or checking account. Suppose that you purchase a CD for six months. Then we say that the CD will mature in six months.
The penalty for early withdrawal is stiff.
