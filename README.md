<h3>Synopsis</h3>
Banks offer various types of accounts, such as savings, checking, certificate of deposit, and money market,
to attract customers as well as meet their specific needs. Two of the most commonly used accounts are savings
and checking. Each of these accounts has various options. For example, you may have a savings account that requires 
no minimum balance but has a lower interest rate. Similarly, you may have a checking account that limits the number
of checks you may write. Another type of account that is used to save money for the long term is certificate of deposit (CD)
